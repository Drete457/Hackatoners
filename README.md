Creation of an Android application based on the general Hackaton theme "Survival" and inspired by the song "Can't Hold us".
It must be mentioned that the application was developed from scratch, from the initial idea of having the final product ready to deploy and use in just 48 hours.

The main idea behind the application was to create and build something that would allow the user to perform random searches of content of interest on their smartphone quickly, with the use of just one button.

It was designed in order to combat the psychological side effects caused by the quarantine state imposed all over the world, through some moments of distraction and fun for the user.
This application also allows the customization of all content, using only the database, which is independent of the application itself.

As a group, we've decided to utilize the Android technology as every group member had zero knowledge on this technology. This project would act as a starting point to learning this amazing technology, that is developing Android Apps using Java and Android Studio.

Technologies, software and methodologies used:
Java, XML, Gradle, Android Studio and Kanban (supported on Trello.)
